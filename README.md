### SafeMammoth üêòüöÄ

SafeMammoth is a deflationary cryptocurrency, running on BEP20 network (atleast for now), Every time a transaction happens, 4% of that transaction is burned and redistributed to every MAMMOTH (SafeMammoth HODLers). This increases the scarcity of $SMMTH in ciculation. What this mean is that everytime $SMMTH is used, the price of $SMMTH will continue to rise as the number of circulating token is drastically decreasing. 

Enough for the deflationary talk, we know that you already knew that! Yes this was inspired by $SAFEMOON, $FEG, $PIG, $RFI which we all knew that it reached atleast x100 up to x1500 by the power of it's deflationary capability and of course the COMMUNITY!!!

We will try to bring you to the moon and engage with all those token who've already reached it!
